# You Will Starve

## How To & FAQ

#### What is You Will Starve?

The purpose of this modpack is to push Minecraft's difficulty to its absolute limit, creating a very rewarding and enjoyable experience for those who crave risk or complexity.

#### How do I survive my first night?

You're going to be best off killing as many mobs as possible for xp while gathering food on your first night, if there's any intent to survive beyond that. Immediately after, finding an easily accessible source of clean water is crucial.

#### How do I mine stone?

More blocks become mineable with each "Mining" level increase. The menu for this can be found as a tab attached to the left of your inventory, or accesed with a hotkey.

## Mods

### LevelZ

The default hotkey to open the skills menu is "k".

An integral aspect of the pack and how it operates - leveling up is a requirement to do anything and everything now. From mining stone, to dealing more damage or increasing movement speed, LevelZ forces the player to first gain and utilize their experience points.

### Dehydration

Dehydration is one of the most challenging additions to You Will Starve. In fact, more often that not, you'll die from thirst before hunger. Maintaining your thirst bar becomes relatively trivial though after crafting a flask.

### EnvironmentZ

Each environment is difficult to navigate for their own reasons, with this mod. In most snowy biomes, you'll need to carry heated stones or wear armor insulated with polar bear fur. In deserts and such, armor will cause the player to overheat.

### BetterSleeping

Bring a bed on your travels. Lack of sleep will apply debuffs such as weakness, slowness, and mining fatigue, increasing the strength and duration of these effects with each night that the player has gone without sleeping.

Upon sleeping, the player will be granted regeneration for 20 seconds.

### Cave Tweaks

Thanks to the creator of Cave Tweaks: Starmute, we have a config perfectly geared to make finding caves more difficult, and to form steep caverns which can be fallen into at death height. If you can make it below the stone layer though, some caves are dramatically larger and more beautiful in deepslate.

### Creeper Overhaul

Creeper Overhaul replaces and expands creepers' capabilities, with a biome-specific variety and some frightening combat.

### Creeper AI Updated

To complement Creeper Overhaul, creepers can now see through walls, spawn charged, and even explode without any current sight of the player, if they had a clue prior as to where you might have went.

### Difficulty+

As the player(s) level up, more dangerous mobs will spawn. Some may have potion effects, greater weapons, or even enchanted armor. This stacks with other mods in the pack which increase time-to-kill or mob damage.

### Dusk

Dusk increases the monster cap during night, making for situations like small horde chases.

### Hardcore Torches

Torches are now temporary and lanterns need to be actively fueled. Torches last 40 minutes, lanterns last 3x as long and must be filled with oil created using animal fat.

### Immersive Travel Overhaul

Coordinates have disappeared from the F3 menu. If you want to get back home, write its coordinates in a journal and navigate with a sextant.

### Mobs Attempt Parkour

Some mobs will try to jump small gaps to reach the player.

### Netural Animals

When provoked, passive mobs like cows or pigs, and even villagers will fight back.

### No Sneaking Over Magma!

Players will take damage when touching a magma block, even when holding Shift.

### Northern Compass

The compass item no longer points to spawn, but to North.

### Quicksand

Like powdered snow, you will sink and slowly die - unless wearing leather boots.

### Realistic Fire Spread

When set on fire, entities will spread the fire to blocks they touch.

### Spice of Fabric

Eating the same foods repeatedly will quickly decline their saturation. Keep a variety of foodstuffs in your inventory, or gather as you go.

### Spiders Produce Webs

As the name implies, spider mobs will have a chance to form webs wherever they go.

### Stacker

All item stack amounts have been changed from 64 to 16 or less.

### The Graveyard

Many structures and scary mobs to deal with, most of which will kill you with a single hit until your first health bar increase.
